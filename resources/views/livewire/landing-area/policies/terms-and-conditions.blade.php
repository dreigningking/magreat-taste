                <li>Binding Arbitration (Last Resort):

            </ul>

            <h2>13. Disclaimers</h2>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">

Indirect, consequential, or punitive damages are excluded. Some jurisdictions do not allow such limitations; in those jurisdictions, liability is limited to the minimum extent permitted by law.</p>

            <h2>15. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Wonegig, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claim, demand, loss, or damage (including legal fees) arising out of your (a) breach of these Terms, (b) misuse of the Services, or (c) violation of any law or third-party right.</p>
