            <h2>Wonegig – Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Copyright Policy</h2>
            <p>Wonegig Technologies Inc. (“Wonegig,” “we,” “our”) respects intellectual-property rights and expects every User to do the same. This policy describes how copyright owners can request removal of infringing material hosted or displayed on the Wonegig platform and how Users can submit a lawful counter-notification if they believe material was removed in error.</p>

            <h2>1. Designated Copyright Agent</h2>
            <p>To maintain DMCA safe-harbor protection under 17 U.S.C. §512, we have registered the agent below with the U.S. Copyright Office.</p>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Send only DMCA-related communications here. Non-DMCA inquiries will not receive a response.</p>

            <h2>2. Filing a DMCA Takedown Notice</h2>
            <p>Under §512(c)(3) a valid notice must include all the elements below. Incomplete submissions will be rejected.</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
                <li>Your contact information – full name, mailing address, telephone number, and email.</li>
                <li>Identification of the copyrighted work you claim is infringed (URL to an authorized version or a clear textual description).</li>
                <li>Identification of the infringing material located on Wonegig – one or more direct URLs that point to the specific page(s), file(s), or project chat messages.</li>
                <li>A statement of good-faith belief that use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (e.g., fair use).</li>
                <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner.</li>
                <li>Your physical or electronic signature (typing your full legal name on an email counts as an electronic signature).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Send the completed notice to: <a href="mailto:dmca@wonegig.com" class="text-primary underline">dmca@wonegig.com</a><br>
            Subject line: “DMCA Takedown Notice – [Your Work Title]”</p>

            <h2>3. Wonegig's Response Procedure</h2>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
                <li>Acknowledgment. We email confirmation of receipt within 48 hours (business days).</li>
                <li>Initial Review. Obvious, facially valid notices trigger temporary disabling or removal of the allegedly infringing content.</li>
                <li>Forwarding. We forward the notice (including your contact details) to the User who posted the content so they understand why it was removed and may respond.</li>
                <li>Repeat-Infringer Policy. Accounts receiving two (2) or more valid DMCA notices within a rolling 12-month period may face suspension or termination, at our discretion.</li>
                <li>Record-keeping. We maintain a log of DMCA notices and actions to preserve safe-harbor eligibility.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>4. Submitting a Counter-Notification</h2>
            <p>If your content was removed and you believe it is non-infringing or qualifies for fair use, U.S. law permits you to send a counter-notification (§512(g)(3)). It must contain:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
                <li>Your contact information – full name, mailing address, telephone number, and email.</li>
                <li>Identification of the material that was removed or disabled and the Wonegig URL(s).</li>
                <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good-faith belief the material was removed or disabled due to mistake or misidentification.</li>
                <li>A statement consenting to jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district where your address is located (or, if outside the U.S., consenting to jurisdiction of any judicial district where Wonegig may be found) and agreeing to accept service of process from the claimant.</li>
                <li>Your physical or electronic signature (full legal name).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Send the counter-notice to: <a href="mailto:dmca@wonegig.com" class="text-primary underline">dmca@wonegig.com</a><br>
            Subject line: “DMCA Counter-Notice – [Removed Content Reference]”</p>
            <p><strong>Restoration timeline:</strong> Unless the original claimant files a lawsuit within 10–14 business days after we forward your counter-notice, we may restore the disputed content.</p>

            <h2>5. Misrepresentation &amp; Penalties</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                <li><strong>False Claims.</strong> Submitting a DMCA notice or counter-notice with knowing misrepresentation of infringement or non-infringement may subject you to statutory damages, including costs and attorneys' fees (§512(f)).</li>
                <li><strong>Account Impact.</strong> We may suspend or terminate Users who file dishonest notices or counter-notices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Non-U.S. Copyright Owners</h2>
            <p>Although the DMCA is U.S. legislation, Wonegig applies this procedure globally to streamline takedown requests. Rights holders outside the U.S. should still follow the steps in §2. We also honor properly formatted notices under equivalent regimes (e.g., EU Copyright Directive, UK CDPA) and may request additional information to verify standing.</p>

            <h2>7. Repeat-Infringer Policy</h2>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
                <li>Strike System. Two (2) valid takedown notices = warning; three (3) = automatic account suspension pending appeal.</li>
                <li>Appeal. Suspended Users may petition reinstatement by demonstrating remedial measures (e.g., copyright training, audit of past uploads).</li>
                <li>Permanent Termination. Severe or egregious violations (e.g., large-scale piracy, intentional distribution of copyrighted software) may lead to immediate permanent ban.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
            <p>We disclose the claimant's and counter-claimant's information exactly as provided to ensure transparency and enable resolution. By filing a notice or counter-notice, you consent to this disclosure.</p>

            <h2>9. Reservation of Rights</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>Wonegig may refuse, redact, or challenge notices or counter-notices that do not comply with the DMCA.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right to seek legal opinions regarding disputed material and to restore content at our sole discretion when lawful grounds exist.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Contact &amp; Questions</h2>
            <p>For clarifications about this policy (not for takedown requests), email <a href="mailto:legal@wonegig.com" class="text-primary underline">legal@wonegig.com</a> with subject "DMCA Policy Query."</p>
